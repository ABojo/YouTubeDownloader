# YouTubeDownloader
YouTube Downloader lets you download YouTube videos in either MP3 or MP4 format.

You can try YouTube Downloader here: https://yt-saver.herokuapp.com/

Users can enter either the URL or video ID into the search bar and then choose between downloading the video or just the audio. The file is streamed back to the client
so the server doesn't need to download the file itself.
